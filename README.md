# Restoring voting rights for formerly incarcerated Floridians
The [Florida Rights Restoration Coalition](https://floridarrc.com) is advocating to restore voting rights to citizens with past felony convictions. The state's current constitution, enacted during Jim Crow, disenfranchises 1 in 4 Black Floridians permanently. Voting is a right, not a privilege, and needs to be treated as such for returning citizens as well.

The FRRC's [ballot initiative](https://www.floridiansforafairdemocracy.com/amendment-text) in 2018 will give over 1.7M people who have completed their sentences the right to vote, along with other important civil rights that come with it such as eligibility to serve on a jury and run for elected office.

To get an initiative on the ballot in Florida, you have to collect nearly 800k signed [petitions](https://floridarrc.com/volunteer#petition) across the state AND there are specific quotas for how many signatures must come from residents living in each of Florida's 27 Congressional districts.

This repo contains updated data/maps to help visualize the Florida Department of Elections' [official signature totals](http://dos.elections.myflorida.com/initiatives/initdetail.asp?account=64388&seqnum=1) for by Congressional district across the state of Florida. Note: the campaign has many more signed petitions than have been counted by the state, so stay tuned for updates.

I hope these maps will be useful for organizations in Florida who are mobilizing volunteers for canvassing and phonebanking to collect the necessary petitions in the next two months to get this initiative on the ballot.

If you are organizing/canvassing on the ground and want targeted voter lists of likely supporters, please contact me at albarrentine@gmail.com.

## Signatures Still Needed by Congressional District

This is the big picture map. Districts are shaded by the number of signatures *still needed* i.e. the required number of signatures minus the number that have been signed already. Lighter regions are essentially done (in terms of petitions, but it's certainly still worth canvassing those areas to get voters involved for 2018), and the darker regions need the most work.

## Signatures Still Needed by County and Congressional District

The county-district map is more tactical. Here we apportion the remaining signatures in a district by counties (or fractions thereof) according to their share of the 2016 Democratic votes in that district. Since counties may be split into multiple districts, the votes for each county-district were rolled up from the more granular precinct tallies. Note: there are some counties that grow more important in this map as they're "carrying" their district in terms of likely supporters e.g. the Miami-Dade portion of District 25, which contains the large ~95% Latina/o city of Hialeah, accounted for over 72% of the Democratic votes from the 25th District, so it makes more sense to spend more time there.
