# Restoring voting rights for formerly incarcerated Floridians
The [Florida Rights Restoration Coalition](https://floridarrc.com) is advocating to restore voting rights to citizens with past felony convictions. The state's current constitution, enacted during Jim Crow, disenfranchises 1 in 4 Black Floridians permanently. Voting is a right, not a privilege, and needs to be treated as such for returning citizens as well.

The FRRC's [ballot initiative](https://www.floridiansforafairdemocracy.com/amendment-text) in 2018 will give over 1.7M people who have completed their sentences the right to vote, along with other important civil rights that come with it such as eligibility to serve on a jury and run for elected office.

To get an initiative on the ballot in Florida, you have to collect nearly 800k signed [petitions](https://floridarrc.com/volunteer#petition) across the state AND there are signature quotas for how many petitions must come from residents living in each of Florida's 27 Congressional districts.

This repo contains updated data/maps to help visualize the Florida Department of Elections' [official signature totals](http://dos.elections.myflorida.com/initiatives/initdetail.asp?account=64388&seqnum=1) for by Congressional district across the state of Florida. Note: the campaign has many more signed petitions than have been counted by the state, so stay tuned for updates.

I hope these maps will be useful for organizations in Florida who are mobilizing volunteers for canvassing and phonebanking to collect the necessary petitions in the next two months to get this initiative on the ballot.

If you are organizing/canvassing on the ground and want targeted voter lists of likely supporters, please contact me at albarrentine@gmail.com.
